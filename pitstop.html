                    One of the biggest things that can make or break your race is a pitstop. If you do not tighten all the lug nuts, get enough fuel in, jump over the wall to quickly or do not do it fast enough you could ruin the race for your driver. But also the driver has to listen to the crew chief and make sure he/she does not speed on pit road.
