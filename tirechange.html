                    Changing in a tire is like riding a bike, once you learn it you will never forget. There are many different way to do it. For example, you can use a machine which is good for tire with a width smaller then 11.5 inches. You could use a machine for a tire bigger than that but it woukd take more time and more effort. In this how to I will teach you step by step to take off a Sk Modified tire/ Whelen Modified Tour tire. You can also use this technique on any tire but it is easier and more efficient for modified tires that are 27 inches wide.

                Steps to take a tire off the rim
                </h3>

                <ul>
                    <li> First you have to take all the air out of the tire outside part of the tire</li>
                    <li> After most of the air is out of the tire, take the bead breaker and put it on the edge of the rim.    </li>
                    <li> Step on part B of the bead breaker with one leg and take part A and bend towards the ground  </li>
                    <li> After you hear the air come out you can take the foot that was on part B and stomp on the sides of the tires that are not broken yet.  </li>
                    <li> After that side is broken, take one spoon and put it between the tire and rim  </li>
                    <li> Then take your second spoon and go over about 3-5 inches and force the spoon end between the tire and rim.  </li>
                    <li> You can now take the first spoon out and put that one 3-5 inches from the second spoon and do the same thing as step 6.   </li>
                    <li> Continue to do this until the outside part of the tire is fully above the rim. </li>
                    <li> You can now flip over the tire and repeat steps 3-4</li>
                    <li> Pull the rim through the back of the tire until the outside edge of the rim stops it.  </li>
                    <li> Then put one spoon between the rim and tire and bend it towards the tire </li>
                    <li> This should make it so most of the tire is off of the edge of the rim</li>
                    <li> Now take the hand this is not holding the spoon and grab the rim and pull </li>
                    <li> The tire is now off the rim </li>
